# Basic CSS

This is a single file CSS, that implements all the basic styling for a website.
It is intended to be used as a simple drop-in replacement for the default CSS
provided by the browser.
It doesn't use any classes, and it doesn't use any preprocessor. It applies
all the styling directly to the elements.

> Supports Dark and Light themes.

## Usage

1. Copy the `style.css` file to your project.
2. Add the following to your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

## References

You can refer the index.html file for a full example of how to use this CSS.
